Data Structure Practice Repository
This repository contains practice exercises and implementations of various data structures in C++. The purpose of this repository is to explore and practice fundamental data structures to enhance understanding and proficiency in C++ programming.

Structures Implemented
Linked List: Implementation of singly linked lists.
Stack: Implementation of a stack using arrays.
Queue: Implementation of a queue using linked lists.
Binary Search Tree: Implementation of a binary search tree with basic operations.
Hash Table: Implementation of a hash table using open addressing.
Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data-Structures.git
Prerequisites
C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
Make sure to have a C++ development environment set up on your machine.
Usage
Navigate to the directory of the desired data structure implementation.
Compile the C++ file(s) using the appropriate command (e.g., g++ -o outputFileName inputFileName.cpp).
Run the compiled program to observe the data structure in action.
Contributing
Contributions are welcome! However, please note that there may be inconsistencies in coding styles or conventions across different data structure implementations. If you wish to contribute, consider maintaining consistency within the respective data structure files or follow the prevailing style. Feel free to review the commit logs for information on coding styles used in previous contributions.

If you want to add more data structures or improve existing ones, fork this repository and submit a pull request with your changes.
