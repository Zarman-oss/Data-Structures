# Data Structure Practice Repository

This repository contains practice exercises and implementations of various data structures in C++. The purpose of this repository is to explore and practice fundamental data structures to enhance understanding and proficiency in C++ programming.

## Structures Implemented

- **Linked List:** Implementation of singly linked lists.
- **Stack:** Implementation of a stack using arrays.
- **Queue:** Implementation of a queue using linked lists.
- **Binary Search Tree:** Implementation of a binary search tree with basic operations.
- **Hash Table:** Implementation of a hash table using open addressing.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data-Structures.git
```

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Make sure to have a C++ development environment set up on your machine.

### Usage

1. Navigate to the directory of the desired data structure implementation.
2. Compile the C++ file(s) using the appropriate command (e.g., `g++ -o outputFileName inputFileName.cpp`).
3. Run the compiled program to observe the data structure in action.
